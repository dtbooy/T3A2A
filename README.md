## Purpose
Our client, Client X is the proprietor of a shuttle bus company and has secured a grant to provide public shuttle service for the Brisbane 2032 Olympics. Client X has requested the development of a full stack web application which will streamline the process of securing a ticket for a shuttle service. This web application will allow users to view and book shuttle bus tickets to and from various venues across Brisbane, ensuring smooth and efficient transportation throughout the duration of the Olympics.

While traditional methods of booking shuttle bus tickets often involve long queues or phone calls, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient for users, our web application offers a more convenient and efficient way for users to book their tickets, saving them time and effort.
Users will be able to access the booking system from anywhere with an internet connection, whether it's from their home, office, or on the go. This accessibility makes it easier for users to plan their transportation needs and book tickets at their convenience. Our web application can provide real-time updates on shuttle bus schedules, availability of seats, and any changes or delays. This ensures that users have accurate information at their fingertips and can make informed decisions when booking their tickets.

Client X has specified that they will be providing services to three main event venues: Brisbane Cricket Ground, Brisbane Arena and Brisbane Football Stadium. They have also specified three locations in Brisbane they will be providing the pick up and drop off services: Eagle Farm, Queen Street Mall Bus Station, Toowong. Client X desires a scalable application architecture that seamlessly accommodates the addition of new locations. This flexibility ensures that the application can efficiently scale to meet evolving business needs, allowing for the effortless integration of additional locations as required.
